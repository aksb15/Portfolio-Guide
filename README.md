# Data Engineering

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|
| 📦 [EDI Orders ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/aksb15/Small-Business-EDI-Order-Tracker) | Python (Pandas) | Built a Python ETL process that transforms messy, merged-cell Excel EDI order files into structured, database-ready tables. Designed as a low-cost alternative for small businesses that can’t afford ERP systems, the pipeline consolidates order history, provides reliable KPIs, and enables better decision-making — all while using affordable tools like Excel and CSV. |

Public ONS datasets were processed and visualised to assess the validity of claims that families are “worse off” today compared to 20 years ago |
